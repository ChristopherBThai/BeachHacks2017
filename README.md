# Created for Beach Hacks 2017
A 24 hour hackathon to build anything you like

## Inspiration
Game development has always been something I loved doing, and since this is my first Hackathon, I believed creating a game would be more comfortable for me during this time period.
## What it does
It's a pretty simple game where the player must dodge and fight for as long as they can. He is also equipped with grappling hook to fly to safety! As the player becomes more comfortable with the controls, more combinations can be excuted with correct timing.
## How I built it
This game was created in Unity using C#. Careful planning was made in order to avoid any inconsistencies or unorganized work. The artwork however, was supplied from royalty-free online websites. I composed the rest of the work done.
## Challenges I ran into
The most difficult challenge I ran into was the unfamiliarity of Unity and C#. I have never used either of these tools and was a challenge to learn and eventually finish a product. Some java background and previous game development did help me tremendously in learning these two tools.
## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
One accomplishment that I'm definantly proud of is finishing within the time period. 24 hours to learn both Unity and C# as well as completing a finished product seemed a bit out of reach in the begginning, but the dedication I was able to bring up payed off well.
## What I learned
Within 24 hours, I have learned more than I can imagine. I completely satisfied with what I was able to accomplish. Unity was much easier then I had anticipated. The structure of this application was really user-friendly. I am definantly using Unity for my next project.
## What's next for Swift Knight
My next step for Swift Knight is to publish it on the Google Play Store. Implementing Android compatibility should be fairly easy using the Unity framework. There are some possibility that I might continue working on this project, but I am mostly using it as a stepping stone for larger projects. I believe that experience is the key to learning, and I have noticed some flaws in my program that I would like to redesign in my future ones. Overall, Swift Knight has given me a key experience to further my hobby as a game developer.
